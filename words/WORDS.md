I'm almost done with this, appart from reviewing the logic and finding a more sensible way of counting sentences and words there are two things I'd like to do next:

- Show a more appropriate reading time. Currently if something would take 70 minutes to read, it will show as such; 70 minutes. Because of space I can't show "1 hour 10 minutes" because it wouldn't fit on some screens, so I'll compromise by going from minutes to hours, so "1 hour 30 minutes" becomes "1.5 hours".
- Deal with the "no spaces" thing.
